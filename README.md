* The tablet (smartphone) can start the paired smartphone’s (tablet’s) Android services.
* The tablet (smartphone) can send Android broadcasts to the paired smartphone (tablet).
* The tablet (smartphone) can send data to the paired smartphone (tablet).

The LG QPair SDK provides open APIs to developers so that their applications can use QPair features.
